The project was made for educational purposes. The author is not responsible for its use.
The bottom line: The code activates the meta mask and phantom wallets by selecting a mnemonic phrase from the official word list. The Selenium library is used. The script works without human intervention, an absolutely automated process. 
From the author: This is not the best code, there are many flaws in it and it can be improved. But this is my first project.
